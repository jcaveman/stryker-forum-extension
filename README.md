### Chrome extension for the Yamaha Stryker forum (and any other forum built on the same platform)

This extension improves the user experience on the forum http://www.yamahastarstryker.com/. It will probably also work on any other forum built using the same platform.

The forum is built on obsolete technology and a lot of the interactions make for a subpar user experience, to say the least. This extension aims to improve on some of those interactions. I built it to use myself and decided to publish it for others to use as well.

###Version 1 includes:
 * Infinite lazy loader on paginated topic threads: This feature makes it much easier to skim through long threads. When you view a thread, it shows 10 posts at a time and the navigation is slow and clumsy. With this extension, scroll to the last post and the next 10 are automatically loaded for you. A small overlay on the upper right of the window tells you what posts you're viewing and the pagination nav is updated to show the current "page". The URL is also updated, so if you lazy load 10 pages and hit reload, you'll get the last posts you were looking at.

 * Image rotator: You know when some knucklehead uploads a photo but it's turned sideways? (don't worry, I've done it too :) ) Now you can rotate any image on the site so that it's upright! Just hold down the "shift" key and click the image. Each click will rotate the image 90 degrees. Keep clicking until the images is where you want it!

That's all for now. I have 100 other ideas including mini-profile pop-ups so you can see someone's garage without having to navigate to their profile, a drag and drop feature for uploading images, et cetera et cetera.
